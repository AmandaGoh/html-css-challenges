## Background & Objectives

A simple challenge to manipulate basic HTML tags and create a first profile page with headers/texts/images/tables.


## Specs

Build a simple HTML page with the following elements (use the right HTML tags):

- an image of yourself
- a header and sub-header with your name and position
- a description of yourself
- your social links
- a table of your favorite movies, sport teams, recipes, etc... depending on your hobbies.

A picture is worth a thousand words, [here is what you should build](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/01-profile-content/)

## Tips & Resources

- You can use [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to find nice social network icons. It is very convenient since it is a **font of icons**, hence it will be very easy to resize these icons, change their color, and add animations on them!

- Don't forget the page `<title>` in the `<head>` section, and other important metatags like `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
