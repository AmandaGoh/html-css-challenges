## Background & Objectives

Create a nice profile dashboard by inserting your infos box into a nice 2D layout. You'll have to use most standard CSS positionning techniques.

## Specs

Here is [the objective](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/05-profile-dashboard/). Before inserting your different profile informations into the layout, start by building this layout step-by-step using most common layout techniques:

- Create and position the main centered container first.
- Then, add two floating div into this container. For the container to wrap these div, you will have to add a third div with `clear: both;` CSS property as you saw in the lecture.
- below the two floating div, add the bottom footer div. Notice the absolute position of the icon list at bottom-right of the last div. You will have to use a `relative>absolute` CSS pattern to get this result.


Your turn!
