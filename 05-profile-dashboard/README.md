## Specs

Here is [the objective](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/05-profile-dashboard/). Before inserting your different profile informations into the layout, start by building this layout step-by-step :

1. Create and position the main centered container.
1. Then, add two floating `<div>` into this container. In order to get the main container wrap these two div, you'll have to use a third div with `clear: both;` CSS property (this is a classic CSS trick).
1. Below the two floating div, add the bottom footer division. Notice the absolute position of the icon list at bottom-right of this footer div. You will have to use a `relative > absolute` CSS pattern to get this result.
