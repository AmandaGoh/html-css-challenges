## Background & Objectives

Add simple CSS rules to design fonts and colors of your profile page.

## Specs

[This is an example](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/02-fonts-colors/) of what you should reproduce. Here is a list of CSS rules to write:

- Pick a nice background color for the `<body>`, for headers (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) and for standard texts (`<p>`, `<a>`, `<li>`, etc...)
- Pick a nice font-family for headers and another one for basic texts.
- Choose nice `font-size` and `line-height` for header and basic texts.
- Resize image `width`
- Add some hover effects on links using the pseudo-class `a:hover`.

## Tips & Resources

- Use Colorzilla plugin to pick nice colors from other websites.
- Pick your fonts on [google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
- For your typo knowledge, **Open Sans** is the standard choice for core texts. **Varela**, **Montserrat** are elegant candidates for headers.
